# GitHub Codespaces
A web-based code environment (the dev environment is hosted in the cloud)

# GitHub Copilot
An AI-assisted development tool that provides autocomplete-style suggestions, summaries of code functionality, and comments to your code

# Git
The tech that powers GitHub; keeps track of all the changes made to the code

# Git Fork
It is creating a copy of code from the main project on GitHub. The code lives in a new project. Make commits and  so on, even cloning repos

# Steps to follow on the course
After creating the codespace on main, waiting for the terminal to be prepared and type in **mkdocs serve**

-----------------------
**pwd** shoes the path to the project

# GitHub codespaces 
A cloud-based development environment that allows you to write, build, and debug your code directly in your browser. With this, we can make changes to the code in GitHub and see the results in real-time in GitHub Codespaces

# meta tags (meta data)
They provide info about the doc such as its author, description, and keywords. This inofs are used by serach engines, browsers to better understand and display our content.

# the lang attribute specifies the language which is used for accessibility and SEO

# defer and src
ensures the script loads after the HTML is fully loaded and parsed which helps improve page load speed and performance and the src attribute specifies the path to the script file

# id and class attributes
The id attribute uniquely identifies and elet, which is useful for applying specific styles in CSS and targetting it with JS. The class attributes allows us to apply the same styles to multiple elements

# Semantic elements
examples are tables, headers, footers, ...

# media queries in CSS
We can use these to adjust our design based on the screen size

# Cascading styleshets
An elet already styled in the html file can not be styled again in the .css file. It'll just be canceled out indicat√≠ng the given style has already been created or entered somewhere else (probably as inline css)

# Cascading and Inheritance
In cascading, styles are applied in a specific order, where more specific rules override general ones. thinh of it like choosing a common colour palette for your house but customizing specific rooms.
On the other hand, in Inheritance, cild elements inherit styles from their parent elements unless explicitly overridden. It's like a room in a house getting the default paint colour from the house but can be repainted differently if needed

# CSS Selectors
this is a specific way to target elements on the web page with an applied styling.e.g **Elements Selctor** tragets all elements based on their type

# Class selectors
targets elelements with a specific class attribute. Classes are like labels that you can give to elements when you want styles to apply to many elements on the screen at once. Do this to layout the plants in the left and right containers. Note that the plants have both id and class attributes. We will use the class attribute later when we will want to drag and drop the specific plants into the terrariumfrom JS.

# Descendent Selector
This targets elements that are descendants of another element.e.g, if you want to resize all ***<img>*** elements that are inside a div element, I use the descendent selector ....***div img***

# Pseudo-clas Selector
This targets elements based on a specific state pr action,e.g If you want to change the heading colour when a user hovers o ers it, you can use the pseudo-class selector...***h1:hover***

# CSS Animations
Brings elements to life by adding motion and visual effects and ***keyframes*** are used to specify the intermediate state of animations and css will generate the in-between frames
